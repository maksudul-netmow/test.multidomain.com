## Deployment
It is supposed that the project is hosted using Laravel Forge and deployed using Envoyer.io

Commands to be added after installing composer dependencies:
```
cd {{release}}

composer update

npm install
npm run production

php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan vendor:publish
php artisan migrate --force

php artisan db:seed --force

php artisan config:cache
```

### Notes
#### Setting up .env file
Let's assume the app will be running on the **app.example.com** domain, so your users will be able to create their shops on your sub-domains, like **acme.example.com**.
In this case, your **.env** file may looks as follow:
```
APP_URL=http://app.example.com
APP_DOMAIN=app.example.com

SESSION_DOMAIN='.example.com'

ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=John
ADMIN_LAST_NAME=Doe
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=my_secure_password
```

#### Development on local environment
It is recommended to use tunneling service like [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com), when developing on your local machine. In this case your **.env** file may looks as follow:

```
APP_URL=http://app.yourapp.ngrok.io
APP_DOMAIN=yourapp.ngrok.io

SESSION_DOMAIN='.yourapp.ngrok.io'

ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=John
ADMIN_LAST_NAME=Doe
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_pa55word
```

#### Available NPM commands
```
npm run watch
npm run dev
npm run production
```
